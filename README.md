**Handwritten Digit Recognition**
This project recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

**Description**
The project uses a CNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving a high accuracy score. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

**Features**
• Loads the MNIST dataset.
• Normalizes pixel values for better performance.
• Implements a CNN model for classification.
• Evaluates the model and prints accuracy score and confusion matrix.

**Requirements**
To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

• tensorflow
• numpy
• sklearn
• matplotlib
• seaborn

You can install these packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Run the script using the following command:

python digit_classifier.py

The output will include the test accuracy and a confusion matrix.
